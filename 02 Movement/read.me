started by recreating the random line example. I used global variables to store colour and a counter, and local variables to set each line’s random start and end points. I added text that displays the current counter value, increasing every frame with counter++. I tested each change by refreshing the browser and checking results.
I also learned how flexible variables can be, by changing one number it can completely affect the movement and appearance.
I wanted to convey hoe life unfolds through randomness, and yet time continues in an orderly and unstoppable motion. I wanted to show how every frame, like life,  is a new moment that can never be repeated.
