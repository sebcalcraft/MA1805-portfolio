In my sketch I showed repetition using arrays, loops and conditionals. A grid of repeating shapes is drawn through a loop and each cell stores its own values inside arrays. When you click a number appears on the box before fading, showing how a single action changes part of a repeating system. I wanted to reflect digital life and how it is structured by repeated actions like scrolling, tapping, waiting, refreshing.
