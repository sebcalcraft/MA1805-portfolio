My emoji shows two faces, one bullying and one being bullied.  
The bully has angry eyebrows and a speech bubble to show harm, while the other face looks sad with a tear.  
My emoji represents how bullying, especially verbally bullying someone, can affect people in negative ways.  
It is a reminder to choose kind words and treat others with respect.
