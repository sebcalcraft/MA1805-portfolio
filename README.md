My project is based on my own experience of repetitive digital actions, which are often seen as mundane like clicking, waiting, refreshing pages, and retrying tasks. These gestures on their own are small but they happen constantly in everyday digital life that they bring light to a bigger problem. My project turns these actions into a visual system where repeated interaction gradually changes how the system behaves. The more the user interacts with it, the less stable and predictable the system becomes. This reflects how digital platforms can respond to attention by escalating activity rather than resolving it. Rather than creating a traditional game with a clear win condition, I wanted to create a system that reacts to the engagement itself.

I wanted my project to explores how digital systems treat interaction as data. Clicking a shape feels intentional, but even missing still affects the system and how it reacts and behaves. This reflects how many platforms record and respond to all user interaction, not just successful actions. As the system process the information, it speeds up and visual stability decreases meanwhile control shifts from the user.

One of the main challenges that I faced was ensuring that the system always responded to interaction, even when the user missed a target. Solving this helped reinforce the idea that all engagement affects the system. To combat this, I used the coding train tutorials to understand better how movement and repetition can be controlled. I used arrays to manage groups of moving elements. I also used loops to repeat actions every frame while using the conditionals to change behaviour over time. I also used lists of words to label certain elements which turned interaction into a form of classification.
